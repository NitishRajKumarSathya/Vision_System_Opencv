This Repo has the Vision system codes of Open CV

We only use this codes to run the live object detection in live cam without taking pics. If we want to get some custom names we need to train the data. In this repo we only use the pre trained model with is available in the open cv website.

We can use this code in live cam and also in recorded video.
